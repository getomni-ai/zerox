### 26.3.1. Declaration & Assignment

Java is a statically typed language meaning that all variables must be declared before you can use them or refer to them. In addition, when declaring a variable, you must specify both its type and its identifier. For example:

```java
int numUnits;
double costPerUnit;
char firstInitial;
boolean isStudent;
```

Each declaration specifies the variableâ€™s type followed by the identifier ending with a semicolon. The identifier rules are fairly standard: a name can consist of lowercase and uppercase alphabetic characters, numbers, and underscores but may not begin with a numeric character. We adopt the modern camelCasing naming convention for variables in our code. In general, variables must be assigned a value before you can use them in an expression. You do not have to immediately assign a value when you declare them (though it is good practice), but some value must be assigned before they can be used or the compiler will issue an error.

The assignment operator is a single equal sign, `=` and is a right-to-left assignment. That is, the variable that we wish to assign the value to appears on the left-hand-side while the value (literal, variable or expression) is on the right-hand-side. Using our variables from before, we can assign them values:

```
2Instance variables, that is variables declared as part of an object do have default values. For objects, the default is `null`, for all numeric types, zero is the default value. For the `boolean` type, `false` is the default, and the default `char` value is `\0`, the null-terminating character (zero in the ASCII table).
```
