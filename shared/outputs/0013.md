## Your Equity Allocation – 82%

### Key Observations

1. **Individual Stocks 96%, ETFs 4%**
2. **Size:** Mid cap stocks overweight, leaving Small cap stocks underweight
3. **Sectors:** Overweight Healthcare, leaving Consumer Discretionary underweight relative to the benchmark weight.
4. **International:** 4% of equity – Lower than Clark Capital’s target range of 25%-35%.

### Diversification Analysis

#### Some Portfolio Overlap – Specific Concentration Risk in MSFT and AAPL

1. Owning multiple funds does not always produce the anticipated diversification benefits. Several securities (e.g. Microsoft, Apple, Meta Platforms) are held directly and by an additional fund.
2. Fund overlap exacerbates concentration concern within the portfolio, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Apple Inc (AAPL) combine for 10.6% of the equity allocation, creating excessive exposure to single stock fluctuations.

**Tax Transition**

This approach illustrates how Clark Capital would attempt to maximize the amount of assets immediately managed within a proposed investment, while spreading realized gains out over time. Gain estimates are relevant to incoming securities only and do not reflect gain/loss from regular trading of Clark Capital investments.

In the first year it is possible to target specific tickers for liquidation/incorporation, a percentage of the remaining unrealized gains, or a dollar value. Subsequent years will target identified tickers, unless otherwise indicated. The approach demonstrated here targets specific tickers for liquidation/incorporation into our investment models.

Positions that are held are monitored on an ongoing basis in partnership with Clark Capital and the financial advisor. If there is a desire to liquidate ahead of schedule, client direction would be required.

Gain/loss estimates are based on cost basis data provided to Clark Capital. Actual gains/loss at time of liquidation will vary. Upon arrival, an updated proposed tax transition plan will be prepared and discussed with the financial advisor and Clark Capital’s Tax Transition Specialist. **The final plan will likely vary from the illustration shown here.**
